- **Pipeline Parallelism**: Implement model sharding across multiple GPUs
- **Request Batching**: Group similar requests for efficient processing

### 3. Quality Improvements
```yaml
# Quality-focused configurations
speculative_decoding_enhanced:
  params:
    lookahead_tokens: 6    # Increased from 4 for better predictions
    verification_threshold: 0.9  # Higher verification standards
    
dynamic_pruning_quality:
  params:
    top_p: 0.95           # Less aggressive pruning
    entropy_threshold: 1.5  # Higher entropy tolerance
```

### 4. Hybrid Strategies
- **Adaptive Policy Selection**: Route requests based on complexity
