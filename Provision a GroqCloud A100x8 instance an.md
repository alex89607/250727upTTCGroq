Provision a GroqCloud A100x8 instance and use llama-3.3-70b-versatile via API. Use the two evaluation suites—CRMArena and WorfBench—into a anaconda or venv workspace so the same virtual-env serves both. Add a slim harness (runner.py) that accepts a YAML manifest of “test-time compute” (TTC) policies; each policy is just a Python class exposing forward(prompt, policy_cfg).

Implement five core TTC algorithms plus two minor variants each:

    Speculative Decoding (main + “4-token look-ahead” variant)

    Dynamic Token Pruning (top-p 0.9 vs. entropy-threshold variant)

    Early-Exit Blocks (exit after 28 / 32 layers)

    Adaptive KV-Cache Shrinking (static vs. cosine decay)

    Elastic Batch Repacking (greedy vs. sorted prompt bucketing)

Each algorithm is a decorator over Groq’s streaming API (groq.Client.stream_chat) that rewrites the prompt, manipulates stop, or short-circuits the generation loop.

For every benchmark, create a JSONL job file mapping sample-id → prompt → ground-truth so the harness can replay identical inputs. Use AsyncIO + tenacity for concurrency and exponential-back-off—Groq allows 100 RPS sustained if you multiplex connections.

Metrics:

    Latency (first_token, avg_token) logged via time.monotonic()

    Throughput (tokens/sec) from Groq response headers

    Quality (exact-match for CRMArena, rouge-L for WorfBench) calculated with Evaluate-ML.

Write results into results.parquet, then a dbt model materialises bench_summary with mean / p95 stats. A quick Streamlit dashboard (streamlit run dash.py) renders a sortable table and violin plots for latency vs. quality trade-offs.

Finally, wrap everything in a GitHub Actions matrix: one job per policy variant, caching the 68 GB model weights with actions/cache@v3. The workflow downloads the benchmarks, executes python runner.py --policy <name>, and uploads the parquet + HTML report as artifacts, giving you reproducible Groq-powered TTC benchmarks in a single click.
